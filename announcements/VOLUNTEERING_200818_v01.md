MENA Devs has been in a hiatus state for a few months now, we haven't been active either online or offline. Many of the members who used to take initiative were busy with their personal lives. The plan currently is to fix all that and reactive many of the existing projects in the pipeline. For that we need volunteers to help!

1. **Moderator for Tilde**: Responsible for managing the job board (approval / rejection of postings) and communicating with companies the appropriate posting guidelines. (Weekly effort: less than 1 hour / week)

2. **Moderator(s) for MENA Devs**: Responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct (CoC) and reactivating the group chat / discussions with relevant / interesting topics (Weekly effort: ~6 hours / week)

3. **Tilde Maintainers**: Tilde (the online portal) has grown and the only person who's been maintaining the project @Costa is not able to do it solo anymore (Weekly effort: ~5 to 6 hours / week [depends on features/bugs in the pipeline too?])

4. **Offline Events Moderator**: Responsible for taking initiative in planning and leading on the execution of offline events (build nights, tech talks, labs etc.) (Monthly effort: 6 to 10 hours)

5. **Developer Survey Lead**: Responsible for administering the yearly Developers Survey, spreading the word, collecting and safeguarding the data and leading on the analysis and report publishing efforts (Yearly effort: 10 to 30 hours)

If you would like to take on any of these roles and the **responsibilities** associated with them please join #volunteering and let's discuss. Once we agree on the modus operandi you'll be leading on these efforts until you're not able to do so anymore and/or someone else volunteers to take on the role.
